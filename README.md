# Credit-Sccore

This model aims to calculate a credit score based on the probability of default for customers in a retail finance company. Although the dataset used in this model is fictitious for security reasons, it aligns with the principles of credit analysis.

The model utilizes the logistic regression method, a popular technique in machine learning, to estimate the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their payments. Logistic regression is a statistical approach that models the relationship between independent variables and a binary outcome, making it suitable for predicting credit risk.

In this repository, you will find the necessary code and documentation to develop and implement the credit score model. The dataset includes the following features:

- AGE: Customer's age
- GENDER: Customer's gender
- MARITAL_STATUS: Customer's marital status
- PROFESSION: Customer's profession
- CITY: City of residence
- HIRING_CHANNEL: Product acquisition channel
- PAYMENT_METHOD: Payment method
- PRODUCT_ID: Product code
- PRODUCT_PRICE: Product price
- SEGMENT_TYPE: Customer type
- COMMERCIAL_CLASS: Customer classification
- ENTRY_DATE: Date when the customer became a client
- TIME_CLIENT: Time as a customer
- VT: VARIABLE TARGER (DEFAULT)

The model's output is a scorecard table, which provides a comprehensive assessment of a customer's creditworthiness. A scorecard combines the information from various predictors and assigns scores to different characteristics, helping in risk assessment and credit decision-making processes. It serves as a valuable tool for evaluating and comparing credit applicants.

Feel free to contribute, enhance, or adapt the credit score model according to your specific needs. Your involvement will aid in refining the accuracy and reliability of credit assessments.
